crossframe.py -- the Harry-Potter "walk out of one frame, into the next" effect.

A character occupying Panel A can WALK OUT (slide + fade off A's right edge),
disappear for a beat, then APPEAR in Panel B (slide + fade in from B's left
edge). The two LED panels are physically separate surfaces (A 256x256 @ (0,0),
B 192x192 @ (256,0) -- see player.py:PANELS), so this is NOT one continuous
canvas with a figure gliding across a seam. It is a *coordinated* exit-then-
enter: the source panel plays an EXIT, both panels show an empty GAP beat, then
the destination panel plays an ENTER. The brief empty frame is what sells the
illusion that the same character left one portrait and arrived in another.

Where it sits in the render stack
---------------------------------
This module produces nothing but a figure layer. It returns an (rgb, alpha)
pair shaped *exactly* like the `rig_frame=` argument that
stage_render.composite_art already accepts:

    rig_frame = (rgb (H, W, 3) uint8, alpha (H, W) uint8)

(see stage_render.py: composite_art / _fit_alpha). So during a transition the
player calls exit_frame()/enter_frame() to get a translated+faded figure layer,
then hands it straight to the existing compositor as `rig_frame=`. The bg plate,
the alpha-over, the panel-size cover-resize, the text overlay, and the liveness
marker are all drawn by stage_render unchanged. crossframe never blits, never
touches pygame, and never reads disk: it is pure numpy and imports anywhere
(headless-safe, like clip_player / stage_render).

The figure the layer carries is the character's static cutout
(data/gen/<slug>_cutout.png, RGBA, figure on transparency -- see
pipeline/segment.py). The caller decodes it once (it already has the
StageRenderer image cache) and passes the RGBA in; this module only does the
geometry (translate toward/away from an edge) and the opacity ramp.

The director beat that triggers a transition
--------------------------------------------
The stage manager (director/stage_manager.py) writes data/stage_state.json. To
move a character between panels it adds a top-level `move` object to the beat:

    {
      "ts": "...",
      "scene": "...",
      "panels": { "A": {...}, "B": {...} },
      "move": { "char": "Phineas", "from": "A", "to": "B" },   <-- NEW, optional
      "bridge": null
    }

`move.char` is the display name (e.g. "Phineas"); `from`/`to` are panel names
("A"/"B"). The player slugifies the name (stage_render.slugify) to find the
cutout, exactly as it does for `panels[*].char`. When `move` is absent the
player renders normally (each panel performs its own beat). The director should
keep `panels` populated for the duration too: panels[from].char is the moving
character (shown only until EXIT completes), and panels[to].char becomes the
moving character (shown once ENTER completes) so the static beat that follows
the transition is already consistent.

Exact per-tick calls the player makes during a transition
---------------------------------------------------------
On the first tick after it sees a new `move`, the player does (once):

    xstate.begin_transition(slug, from_panel="A", to_panel="B")

Then every tick while `not xstate.done`:

    xstate.advance(dt)                       # dt = seconds since last tick (1/FPS)
    a_phase, a_prog = xstate.panel_state("A")
    b_phase, b_prog = xstate.panel_state("B")

and for EACH panel it decides what to render:

  * The panel currently in PHASE_EXIT  (the from-panel during EXIT):
        layer = exit_frame(panel_rect, cutout_rgba, a_prog, direction="right")
        render_stage(screen, "A", panelA, beatA, frame, fonts, rig_frame=layer)
    -> figure slides toward / off the panel's right edge, fading out.

  * The panel currently in PHASE_ENTER (the to-panel during ENTER):
        layer = enter_frame(panel_rect, cutout_rgba, b_prog, direction="left")
        render_stage(screen, "B", panelB, beatB, frame, fonts, rig_frame=layer)
    -> figure slides in from the panel's left edge, fading in.

  * A panel in PHASE_GAP, PHASE_PRE, or PHASE_DONE renders its *normal* content
    for that beat (no rig_frame override) -- EXCEPT the moving character must not
    appear in a panel it has logically left/not-yet-entered. The simplest correct
    rule, and the one the docstring above bakes into the beat, is:
        - during the whole transition, suppress the moving char on the to-panel
          until ENTER starts, and on the from-panel once EXIT finishes. The
          player does this by passing rig_frame=_EMPTY_LAYER(panel_rect) (a fully
          transparent layer) for that panel, which composites to "bg plate only,
          no figure" -- i.e. the empty frame.

`direction` is derived from the panel geometry by the player: a figure leaving
toward the destination exits the edge that faces it. For the canonical A(left)->
B(right) layout that is exit "right" / enter "left". A B->A move is exit "left" /
enter "right". `edge_for_move(from_panel, to_panel, panels_geometry)` is provided
so the player doesn't hardcode it.

Phase model
-----------
    PHASE_PRE   -- transition requested, not started (0-length unless paused)
    PHASE_EXIT  -- from-panel: figure slides off its facing edge, alpha 1->0
    PHASE_GAP   -- neither panel shows the figure (the empty beat)
    PHASE_ENTER -- to-panel: figure slides in from its facing edge, alpha 0->1
    PHASE_DONE  -- arrived; player resumes normal rendering

Durations are module constants (seconds): EXIT_S, GAP_S, ENTER_S.
