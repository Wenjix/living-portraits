"""voice_eval.py -- measure per-character voice DISTINCTNESS + FIDELITY via z.ai.

Runs each character on a fixed battery of identical situational prompts, using the REAL
deployed system prompt (heartbeat.BASE_SYSTEM + _identity_block) -- so it tests whatever
the heartbeat currently builds. Scores:

  * catchphrase_rate  -- fraction of a character's outputs that fire >=1 of its catchphrases
  * attribution_acc   -- a BLIND judge, shown one line + the 3 character essences, guesses
                         who said it. High accuracy == voices are distinct AND faithful
                         (no bleed). Random baseline with 3 characters = 0.33.

Re-run before/after any prompt change to PROVE the voice improved (or didn't regress):
    python director/voice_eval.py                 # 1 draw per (char,prompt)
    python director/voice_eval.py --draws 2        # more draws
    python director/voice_eval.py --tag before     # label the run

Writes the full transcript + scorecard to data/mind/voice_eval_<tag>.json (gitignored).
Stdlib + the z.ai client only; key auto-resolves (see director/llm.py).
