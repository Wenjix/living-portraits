# bringup_host.ps1 -- GENERALIZED, host-adaptive bring-up for living-portraits.
#
# sc2_bringup.ps1 (the sibling) is SC2-specific: it assumes .venv-gen already
# exists with torch 2.5.1+cu121 baked in, and only adds the lighter producer
# deps on top. THIS script makes no such assumption. It DETECTS the host's GPU
# and picks one of two self-consistent paths, so the same file brings up either
# the generative backend OR a GPU-less display/re-rig host with no edits.
#
# WHY: the migration target hil08rd's GPU is UNKNOWN. A bring-up that hard-codes
# "torch+cu121 is already here" (sc2_bringup) or "this box has an RTX" would
# either crash or silently install a multi-GB CUDA stack onto a box that can't
# use it. This script asks the host what it is, then does the right thing.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE TWO PATHS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   GPU PRESENT  -- the host is a self-contained PRODUCER (like SC2).
#     Builds .venv-gen from scratch, installs torch (cu121) + diffusers stack +
#     piper TTS + voices + insightface/onnxruntime + SAM-pip deps, checks for
#     ollama and pulls qwen3:8b (the director model) + the VL model (the verify
#     register gate), then runs the producer backfill (orchestrate --all). After
#     this the host can generate portraits, run the verify gate at full strength,
#     and serve the director -- it owes nothing to another machine.
#
#   GPU ABSENT   -- the host is a DISPLAY + RE-RIG node (pairs with a backend).
#     Builds the lean runtime .venv only: pygame + opencv + numpy +
#     imageio-ffmpeg + Pillow + piper-tts + voices. NO torch, NO diffusers, NO
#     SD weights. Generation and the qwen3 director come from the SC2 backend
#     (assets arrive via syncer's sync_assets.ps1; the director is reached by
#     pointing LP_OLLAMA at the backend's Ollama). Segmentation (GrabCut) and the
#     rig math are pure opencv+numpy, so this host CAN still segment + re-rig
#     synced cutouts locally -- it just can't paint new portraits or score the
#     ArcFace/VL gates.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE CONDUCTOR'S RUN COMMAND  (same shape as install/BRINGUP.md)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   # 0. Dot-source the remote-PS helper (handles BOM + base64 EncodedCommand).
#   . C:\Users\jtole\Documents\2026\life\scripts\invoke-remote-ps.ps1
#
#   # 1. scp this script to the target host (pure ASCII, no BOM -- straight scp OK).
#   scp C:\Users\jtole\Documents\2026\life\projects\living-portraits\install\bringup_host.ps1 `
#       <user>@<host>:C:/Users/<user>/living-portraits/install/bringup_host.ps1
#
#   # 2. Run it on the host. It auto-detects GPU and streams every step's verdict.
#   Invoke-RemotePS -Host_ <user>@<host> -Script @'
#   & powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\<user>\living-portraits\install\bringup_host.ps1
#   '@
#
# GPU-ABSENT hosts pair with two things the conductor wires SEPARATELY:
#   * ASSETS  -- syncer's sync_assets.ps1 mirrors SC2's data\gen + data\clips +
#                the clip manifest down to this host (this script does NOT sync).
#   * DIRECTOR -- set LP_OLLAMA on this host to the backend's Ollama endpoint
#                (e.g. setx LP_OLLAMA http://100.123.185.12:11434) so the local
#                director loop talks to SC2's qwen3 instead of a missing local one.
#                (See the GPU-absent tail of this script -- it prints the exact line.)
#
# Override the GPU decision for testing with -ForceCpu / -ForceGpu. Pass
# -SkipBackfill to install deps without running the producer backfill (GPU path).
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DESIGN (same contract as sc2_bringup.ps1)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every step is wrapped so ONE failure does NOT abort the rest. Each step prints
# exactly one of OK / SKIP / FAIL so the conductor reading the transcript sees
# what landed without parsing stack traces. Idempotent: pip is a no-op when
# satisfied, voice download skips when the .onnx already exists, the producer
# backfill registers only NEW clean passes (never duplicates a clip row), and an
# already-pulled Ollama model is detected and skipped.
#
# Layout: drop at <project>\install\bringup_host.ps1. Run from anywhere -- it
# derives the project root as the parent of its folder.
