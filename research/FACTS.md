## A. Living Portraits as a context graph

### [LP-GRAPH] The graph itself (graph_viewer.html)
- Living Portraits ships a real interactive graph view titled "Video Knowledge Graph" (`graph_viewer.html`, rendered with vis-network).
- NODES are frames: each node is a pose that carries its still image plus its gen prompt (the SDXL/MJ generation prompt) as semantic metadata.
- EDGES are video clips. Two kinds:
  - idle self-loops (a clip that loops on one pose); drawn as solid edges tinted to the character.
  - transitions (pose to pose): a clip that ties one frame to a different one and carries its MJ motion prompt; drawn as a dashed orange edge (`#ff5a3c`), plays once, has an arrow.
- The player random-walks this graph by day.
- Per-character node color: Phineas gold `#d4a85a`, Seraphina teal `#78ccc2`, MAXX-9 magenta `#ff3df0`. The bedtime / circadian layer is indigo `#8b6cff`.
- The viewer footer reports live counts from `data/clips/video_graph.json`: N frames, N clips, N idle + N transition, N characters. (Exact totals are runtime data; do NOT hardcode a number on a slide. Say "dozens of poses and clips" or show the graph, not a fabricated count.) [LP-GRAPH]

### [LP-CAST] The cast (gallery.yaml)
- Three characters, each a node-set with its own persona, voice, and node color:
  - Master Phineas Quill (panel A): a washed-up tragedian, mood "tragic-grandiose", voice en_GB-alan. Node gold.
  - Seraphina Vane: a Restoration-era wit, mood "wry-complicit", voice en_GB-jenny. Node teal.
  - MAXX-9 (panel B): a "legally-distinct discount action hero", voice en_US-ryan. Node magenta.
- The personas relate: Phineas resents the brighter frame next door (Seraphina); MAXX-9 is the loud neon anachronism Phineas loathes. (Relationships are graph context, not just decoration.) [LP-CAST]

### [LP-HEARTBEAT] The heartbeat memory loop (AUTONOMY.md)
- An LLM "heartbeat" gives each portrait a life: `director/heartbeat.py` is the slow brain that runs sense, then think, then write.
  - sense: pulls real-world context (see [LP-CONTEXT]) plus each character's recent pose state and journal.
  - think: a single GLM decision (model glm-4.5-air) picks a goal pose for the character.
  - write: writes `data/mind/intent.json` (the goal) and appends one line to `data/mind/journal/<char>.jsonl` (the character's inner monologue, fed back next tick).
- The walker reads the graph and the intent: `runtime/mind.py:decide()` runs `runtime/pathfind.py:next_step()` (a BFS over the transition edges) to find the next single hop toward the goal, forces that one transition, lands one pose closer, and asks again. A visible step-by-step walk. At the goal it pins on idle loops.
- THE GRAPH IS THE MEMORY the loop reads and writes: the heartbeat reads pose state + journal and writes intent; the walker reads intent + the graph and writes pose state. Single-writer per file, no races. All writes atomic (tmp + os.replace). [LP-HEARTBEAT]

### [LP-PRECEDENCE] One graph, layered traversals (AUTONOMY.md + circadian.py)
- Three goal-setters drive the same body, in strict precedence:
  `circadian (the clock) > mind (the LLM intent) > random walk (fallback)`.
- circadian (`runtime/circadian.py:decide()`) is a hardcoded goal-seeker: when the wall clock crosses a character's bedtime window it stops wandering and walks a scripted BEDTIME ROUTINE (hub, nightcap, exit offscreen, return in nightclothes, prep, sleep), dwelling a few idle loops per beat, then dwells at the sleep pose until wake hour, then walks the chain in reverse.
- mind (`runtime/mind.py:decide()`) is the SAME decide() contract as circadian, but its goal is the LLM-chosen pose by day.
- So it is ONE graph with multiple traversals over it: a daytime LLM-goal walk, a daytime random walk, and a nightly circadian chain. Same nodes and edges, different ways to walk them. [LP-PRECEDENCE]

### [LP-STALE] Fail-soft staleness guard (mind.py + AUTONOMY.md)
- A goal older than `DEFAULT_MAX_AGE` (30 minutes, `1800.0` seconds in `runtime/mind.py`) is ignored. If the heartbeat dies or is blocked, the portraits degrade to the lively random walk, never frozen at a stale goal.
- `runtime/circadian.py` and `runtime/mind.py` and `runtime/pathfind.py` are pure, stdlib-only, import-safe (imported by the 10 fps render loop). All network and LLM code lives in `director/`. [LP-STALE]

### [LP-CONTEXT] Real-world context into the prompt (director/context.py)
- `director/context.py:context_line()` pulls IC `GET /api/context` (Frontier Tower SF local weather + time, Open-Meteo behind it) and renders ONE short natural phrase for the heartbeat prompt, e.g. "a chilly 63F overcast afternoon in SF; the sun sets at 8:33pm".
- Fail-soft by contract: it swallows ALL failure (no token, network down, non-2xx, bad JSON) and returns an empty string, never raising. No network at import time. TTL-cached to `data/mind/context.json` (15 min TTL) so almost every ~4-min tick is served from cache with zero network. A dead source just omits the clause; it can NEVER break a heartbeat tick. [LP-CONTEXT]

### [LP-BRAIN] The brain (AUTONOMY.md)
- Model: glm-4.5-air (fast, cheap, right for a per-tick decision; glm-4.6 available for richer Phase-2 prompts).
- Path: `director/llm.py` posts to the IC z.ai gateway (Anthropic Messages shape) with an IC-minted `agt_` proxy key that carries ZERO IC tool scopes, so it is safe on an unattended host. The gateway holds the real Z.ai org key and meters a weekly token budget. [LP-BRAIN]

### [LP-DEPLOY] Where it runs (README.md + AUTONOMY.md)
- Runs unattended on a dedicated host (referred to as "hil" in the autonomy deploy runbook); the original player box is supercommons2 (i9-9900K / 64GB / RTX 2080 Ti).
- The player is deterministic and plays pre-baked clips; nothing is generated in realtime in the show loop. A self-heal watchdog keeps it alive (README status + `lp_watchdog_preview.ps1` / `start_portraits.ps1`). [LP-DEPLOY]
- UNVERIFIED-LIVE: exact current host name and uptime are runtime facts; do not state a specific uptime number on a slide.

### [LP-PHASE1] What is actually built (AUTONOMY.md)
- Phase 1 ("the brain over existing poses") is marked BUILT: pathfind + mind + heartbeat + walker hook + 14 tests + a live-validated LLM. GLM picks among EXISTING poses; the graph walks there. No new image generation in this phase.
- Phase 2 (autonomous pose growth: the mind requests a brand-new pose, an `lp-gen` worker runs the MJ pipeline, the walker hot-reloads the graph) is designed, not the claim of this talk. Tag any Phase-2 statement as roadmap. [LP-PHASE1]

## B. RAG research grounding (life/research)

### [RAG-FARM] The pgvector embedding farm (research/embed/README.md)
- life/research runs a distributed RAG farm: a cluster-native paper embedder runs `nomic-embed-text` on each node and writes 768-dim vectors to a central Postgres 16 + pgvector instance (db `research`, on the `immersivecommons` box over the tailnet).
- Schema: a `papers` table (paper_id, title, abstract, year, authors, embedding vector(768), embedded_at). Work queue = rows WHERE embedded_at IS NULL; nodes pull jobs via FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED. Scale by adding boxes. [RAG-FARM]
- This is a real, running flat-vector store: it is exactly the "nearest chunks by similarity" baseline a context graph is contrasted against.

### [RAG-CROSS] cross_search (research/cross_search.py)
- `research/cross_search.py` (also `python -m research.cross_search`) is the retrieval entry point over that farm. [RAG-CROSS]

### [RAG-GRAPHRAG] GraphRAG vs flat RAG, as a named industry move (research/AGENTIC_SOTA_v1.md + SOTA_UPGRADE.md)
- The life/research SOTA scan names the graph-structured memory direction explicitly. Mechanisms catalogued include:
  - a temporal knowledge graph with edge invalidation (Zep),
  - a hippocampal-index knowledge graph traversed by Personalized PageRank for cheap multi-hop retrieval (HippoRAG / HippoRAG 2),
  - memory-stream + reflection synthesis with recency/importance/relevance retrieval (Generative Agents),
  - "preserve raw events verbatim, run extraction at retrieval time not ingestion" (Storage-is-not-Memory).
- Honest caveat the scan records: Microsoft GraphRAG community-summary indexing was a deliberate SKIP for this corpus because it caused a ~370x token blowup; LLM-as-reranker was skipped (~270x slower for ~2 nDCG points). So "graph beats flat" is a SHAPE claim (relationships, reachability, multi-hop), NOT a blanket "always cheaper" claim. State it that way. [RAG-GRAPHRAG]
- Provenance the scan cites: HippoRAG 2 (arXiv 2502.14802), Qwen3-Embed/Rerank (2506.05176), Anthropic Contextual Retrieval, Jina late-chunking (2409.04701). [RAG-GRAPHRAG]

### [RAG-CONTRAST] The core contrast (synthesis of LP-GRAPH + RAG-FARM + RAG-GRAPHRAG)
- Flat RAG: embed everything, retrieve the nearest chunks by cosine similarity. You get the most-similar pieces, but no relationships, no order, no reachability, no path between them.
- Context graph: memory as nodes plus TYPED edges. Retrieval becomes a WALK (traverse typed edges), not a similarity scan. You get reachability, ordering, and grounded multi-hop the model can actually traverse.
- Living Portraits is the toy that makes this literal: the "nearest pose" is meaningless; what matters is which pose you can REACH and the path the body takes to get there (pathfind BFS). [RAG-CONTRAST]

## C. Asimov / Reflection AI (verified via WebSearch 2026-06-26)

### [ASIMOV] Asimov is a real context-graph product
- Reflection AI (founded by alumni of Google DeepMind) launched Asimov in July 2025. [ASIMOV-SEQUOIA] [ASIMOV-DOCS]
- Asimov is a code-RESEARCH / code-comprehension agent: it helps engineers understand large existing codebases rather than primarily generating new code. Company framing: roughly 70% of engineering time is spent reading and understanding existing systems, not writing new code. [ASIMOV-SILICONANGLE] [ASIMOV-SEQUOIA]
- It builds a knowledge graph: it continuously indexes entire GitHub repositories AND architecture docs, chat threads (Slack / Teams), issue trackers (Jira), and commit histories, to construct a living knowledge graph of the codebase plus the institutional knowledge around it ("learns from more than just code"). [ASIMOV-SILICONANGLE] [ASIMOV-DOCS]
- Architecture: many small long-context retriever agents that pull relevant info from the large codebase, plus one large short-context reasoning agent (the combiner) that synthesizes a coherent answer. [ASIMOV-DOCS]
- Deploys inside the customer's own VPC so proprietary source stays in their cloud. [ASIMOV-DOCS]
- Why it belongs on the slide: it is the same pattern at industry scale. Model the domain (a codebase + its team knowledge) as a graph; reason by retrieving over that graph, not by dumping files into a flat window. Living Portraits is the small, visible version of the same idea. [ASIMOV]
- Reflection AI funding is web-verified but is NOT load-bearing for this talk; treat it as optional color, not a slide claim. Confirmed timeline: March 2025 raised $130M (a $25M seed plus a $105M Series A) at about a $545M valuation, led by Lightspeed and Sequoia; October 2025 raised $2B at an $8B valuation (investors include Nvidia, Eric Schmidt, Lightspeed, Sequoia); as of early 2026 reported to be raising a further round near a $20B valuation. [ASIMOV-TC] [ASIMOV-WIKI] [ASIMOV-SACRA]
- UNVERIFIED: any specific Asimov benchmark number, accuracy claim, customer count, or pricing. Do not put those on a slide. The "~70% of engineering time is reading code" figure is the company's own framing, not an independent measurement; attribute it to Reflection if used. State only the qualitative architecture facts above.
